                Stem & \multicolumn{10}{l}{ Leaf}\\
                \hline
                0&6&6&7&8&9&9\\

        \subsection*{Section A(2) (35 marks)}
        
        \item It is given that $f(x)$ is composed of 3 parts. The first part varies as constant. The second part and the third part varies directly and inversely with $x$ respectively. Suppose that $f(1)=f(-1)$, $2f(2)=5$ and $4f(4)=19$.\begin{enumerate}

        \end{enumerate}

        \item The table below shows the distribution of the range of years of sentence of prisoners in a certain jail.
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tabular}{||c||c|c|c|c||}
                \hline
                Years of sentence & 1 - 10 & 11 - 20 & 21 - 30 & 31 - 40\\
                \hline
                Number of prisoners & 109 & 75 & $n$ & $n$ - 10\\
                \hline
            \end{tabular}
        \end{center}
        It is given that the expected years of sentence in the jail is 17.5 years if a random prisoner is chosen.\begin{enumerate}
            \item Find the median group and mode group of the distribution. \hfill (4 marks)
            \item Tommy was one of the prisoners in this jail with less than 10 years of sentence. During period of sentence, he murdered 3 prisoners whose years of sentence are below 10 years. He then received an extension of sentence. The mean of the new distribution is nearly unchanged. In what range of years of sentence should Tommy be extended to? \hfill (3 marks)
        \end{enumerate}

        \item Given that $f(x)$ is a polynomial such that $(x-1)f(x)$ is divisible by $x^2+x+1$.\begin{enumerate}
            \item Show that $f(x)$ is divisible by $x^2+x+1$. \hfill (3 marks)
            \item Consider $g(x)$ is a polynomial such that $f(x)$ is a factor of $g(x)$. Someone claims that if $(x-1)g(x)$ is divisible by $x^3$ then $g(x)$ is at least of degree 5. Is the claim correct? Explain your answer. \hfill (4 marks)
